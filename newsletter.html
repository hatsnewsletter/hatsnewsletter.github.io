      Georg Nees: Computergrafik
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      Georg Nees: Computer Graphics was the first exhibition worldwide of graphic works algorithmically generated by a digital computer.
- The exhibition took place at the Siemens company in Erlangen, Germany from February 5 to 19, 1965.
- The exhibition was held at the "Studiengalerie der TH Stuttgart" under the auspices of the Ästhetisches Colloquium.
- It inspired a later exhibition at the Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart that took place in November 1965.
- Georg Nees was the only artist represented in the exhibition, and his works were generated by a properly programmed digital computer.
- The exhibition was suggested by Helmar Frank and invited by Max Bense, who published a small booklet called "rot" that became one of the first publications in the field of computer art.
- The booklet contains drawings exhibited in the show along with short pseudo-code. Max Bense wrote a text called "Projekte generativer Ästhetik," which is considered the manifesto of computer art.
- The title of the exhibition and the number and selection of works are uncertain, but Georg Nees estimates he exhibited ten to twelve small-sized graphics.
- At the opening, an artist-professor from the Stuttgart Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste asked Nees if he could make his computer draw in the same manner as the artist. Nees responded with the condition that the artist must tell him how they draw.
- The word "Artificial Art" was coined by Max Bense in this interaction.
