      Georg Nees: Computergrafik
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      Georg Nees: Computer Graphics was the first exhibition worldwide of graphic works algorithmically generated by a digital computer.
- The exhibition took place at the Siemens company in Erlangen, Germany from February 5 to 19, 1965.
- The exhibition was held at the "Studiengalerie der TH Stuttgart" under the auspices of the Ästhetisches Colloquium.
- It inspired a later exhibition at the Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart that took place in November 1965.
- Georg Nees was the only artist represented in the exhibition, and his works were generated by a properly programmed digital computer.
- The exhibition was suggested by Helmar Frank and invited by Max Bense, who published a small booklet called "rot" that became one of the first publications in the field of computer art.
- The booklet contains drawings exhibited in the show along with short pseudo-code. Max Bense wrote a text called "Projekte generativer Ästhetik," which is considered the manifesto of computer art.
- The title of the exhibition and the number and selection of works are uncertain, but Georg Nees estimates he exhibited ten to twelve small-sized graphics.
- At the opening, an artist-professor from the Stuttgart Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste asked Nees if he could make his computer draw in the same manner as the artist. Nees responded with the condition that the artist must tell him how they draw.
- The word "Artificial Art" was coined by Max Bense in this interaction.

      Is cat purring chaotic? -Not David
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      Not David investigates the science of cat purring, examining whether it is a chaotic or orderly process involving muscle, nerve, and brain coordination. It highlights the diversity in purring patterns among cats, linking this to chaos theory and its prevalence in many other phenomena.

      Carl Bugeja’s Self-Reflowing Circuit Boards
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      Carl Bugeja shares his design and testing process of his self-soldering circuit boards. The PCB's ground plane layer is transformed into a resistor to heat up and melt solder, enabling the circuit to self-assemble and potentially create daughter circuits.

      Mixing 3D Printing + Fungi for Experimental Building Materials
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      PLP Architecture is pioneering in construction by combining 3D printing with fungi to create eco-friendly building materials. Their method involves using wood-based PLA molds infused with mycelium bio-composites, resulting in lightweight, fire-resistant materials ideal for soundproofing and insulation.
