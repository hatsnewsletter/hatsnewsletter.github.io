    "summary": "For three months every year, the Italian town of Viganella is shrouded in darkness, thanks to the surrounding mountains. In 2006, architect Giacomo Bonzani proposed a solution: a massive mirror, 8 meters wide and 5 meters tall, installed on a nearby peak. Controlled by software, the mirror reflects sunlight into the main square for 6 hours daily, bringing warmth and light. Beyond practical benefits, it fosters socialization in the town's quiet winters and since has inspired similar efforts, like the one in Rjukan Norway.",
