       Reaction wheels are heavy disks connected to motors. One use for them is to steer and orient satellites using the conservation of momentum. In this video Breaking Taps explains how a different design that circulates liquid metal around works and builds a few of his own. While this alternative seems mostly useful for spacecraft, it’s possible we will see these motors in other applications.

       Daniel Valuch at CERN gets his hands on a pendulum clock. He modifies it, adding in a phase locked loop to sync it to a super-precise caesium fountain clock (which they of course have), so that the old grandpa clock deviates less than a second in 158 million years. The resulting system ends up successfully correcting for vibrations from an earthquake (granted, one that’s very far away).

       The Italian Town That Built Its Own Sun
      </h3>
      <p class="summary">
       For three months every year, the Italian town of Viganella is shrouded in darkness, thanks to the surrounding mountains. In 2006, architect Giacomo Bonzani proposed a solution: a massive mirror, 8 meters wide and 5 meters tall, installed on a nearby peak. Controlled by software, the mirror reflects sunlight into the main square for 6 hours daily, bringing warmth and light. Beyond practical benefits, it fosters socialization in the town's quiet winters and since has inspired similar efforts, like the one in Rjukan Norway.

       What Happens When You Break the Rules of Tape Loops? - iturnknobs

      <p class="summary">
       Cassettes have two sides and ends, and once one side is finished, you flip it around. Looper tapes offer a continuous playback with a single loop of magnetic tape, but their length is typically short. Increasing the length is a topological challenge against tape bundling. In this video, iturnknobs explores a concept inspired by the Roland RE-201 to extend loop length by several minutes. But can you double the length of playback using the second side of the tape, much like a Möbius strip?
