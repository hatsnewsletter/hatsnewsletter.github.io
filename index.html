      Is cat purring chaotic? - YouTube
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      The article and video titled "Is cat purring chaotic?" explores the science behind why cats purr and whether it is a chaotic or organized process. Purring is a complex phenomenon that involves the coordination of various muscles, nerves, and brain signals. It is interesting to note that different cats have different purring patterns, with some having a steadier and more consistent purr while others have a more irregular and chaotic purr. The article dives deeper into the mathematics of the chaos theory and how it is all around us.

      USB-C head-to-head teardown
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      - Apple's Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) Pro cable supports Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB 4 data transfer with speeds up to 40 Gb/s and can deliver up to 100 W of power.
- The Thunderbolt connector has a stainless steel enclosure and a strain relief crimped in from eight different directions.
- The Thunderbolt cable has 24 pins on a 10-layer PCB board with blind and buried vias.
- There is a wiggle detour on one of the traces to ensure the same length as its paired trace for high-speed data transmission.
- The Thunderbolt cable contains different types of wires for charging and data transfer, including coaxially shielded conductors for high-speed data and unshielded wires for power and legacy USB 2.0 functionality.
- Amazon Basics USB-C cable is much cheaper and offers charging up to 60 W and data transfer speeds up to 480 Mbps.
- The Amazon Basics connector has two-armed strain relief and shielding anchored on the cable, with only 12 pins, four pairs of which are jumped across the PCBA.
- The NiceTQ USB-C cable is a primitive cable with no metal shielding, a plastic enclosure strain relief, and eight pins, with only four connecting to the cable.
- The NiceTQ cable has straightforward stranded conductors embedded in two layers of insulation, but it only supports USB 2.0 speeds.
- The ATYFUER USB-C cable is a charging cable with a full set of 24 pins on a PCB, though only 12 are connected to traces and wires configured for U.
