      How Telegram Became a Terrifying Weapon in the Israel-Hamas War | WIRED
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      - Telegram played a significant role in the Israel-Hamas war by allowing Hamas to spread gruesome images and videos that went viral.
- The lack of content moderation on Telegram allowed extreme content to reach millions of people.
- Hamas had a huge presence on Telegram during the attacks, with its channels quickly growing in size.
- Videos shared on Telegram showed Hamas fighters entering Israel, capturing IDF soldiers, and conducting attacks.
- Hamas' ability to post and upload content in real-time during the attacks showcased a sophisticated media strategy.
- Telegram has been reluctant to ban channels disseminating extreme content, citing the difficulty of policing speech in a conflict.
- The power of Telegram to spread unfiltered content ahead of traditional media reveals the outsize influence of the platform.
- Telegram's headquarters in Dubai has placed it at the center of complex geopolitical and humanitarian crises multiple times.
