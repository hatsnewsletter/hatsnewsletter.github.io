       Rodney Brooks, one of the founders of iRobot (of Roomba fame) and many other robotics startups, provides an annual update on his predictions related to self-driving cars, robotics, AI and space travel. This year he focuses on the developments made in self-driving cars and addresses the advancements in generative AI. Contrary to most predictions of this sort, he has a more modest assessment of the pace of technological development.

      <p class="summary">
       I came across this tool from Formlabs while exploring how I could get a SLS-like rough texture on my Resin 3D printed parts. This is a cool tool that enables you to add texture to a part or the whole of your STL file before 3D printing. You have to take care to have a uniform mesh for the texture to work well. Still not over what happened to Micronics though :(

       The Italian Town That Built Its Own Sun
      </h3>
      <p class="summary">
       For three months every year, the Italian town of Viganella is shrouded in darkness, thanks to the surrounding mountains. In 2006, architect Giacomo Bonzani proposed a solution: a massive mirror, 8 meters wide and 5 meters tall, installed on a nearby peak. Controlled by software, the mirror reflects sunlight into the main square for 6 hours daily, bringing warmth and light. Beyond practical benefits, it fosters socialization in the town's quiet winters and since has inspired similar efforts, like the one in Rjukan Norway.

       What Happens When You Break the Rules of Tape Loops? - iturnknobs
      </h3>
      <p class="summary">
       Cassettes have two sides and ends, and once one side is finished, you flip it around. Looper tapes offer a continuous playback with a single loop of magnetic tape, but their length is typically short. Increasing the length is a topological challenge against tape bundling. In this video, iturnknobs explores a concept inspired by the Roland RE-201 to extend loop length by several minutes. But can you double the length of playback using the second side of the tape, much like a Möbius strip?

       Carpentopod: A walking table project
      </h3>
      <p class="summary">
       Inspired heavily by Theo Jansen’s “Strandbeest”, Gilliam de Carpentier turns the dynamic sculpture idea to a functional walking wooden coffee table. The design process involves a genetic algorithm to compare various mechanisms optimizing for minimum bobbing and foot slip. High-quality materials, such as CNC cut bamboo, and wireless control are two features not to miss.
