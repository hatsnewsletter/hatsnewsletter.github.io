      picoSYNTH by Johan Peitz
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      - picoSYNTH is a downloadable tool for creating simple loops and beats on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- It allows users to build rigs in playful and straightforward ways and make music and loops.
- Users can tune sounds and beats live, choose from multiple waveforms and equipment, and wire up their creations for unexpected results.
- The tool supports saving files in an easy-to-read text format and exporting them to WAV for use in other platforms.
- The quickstart guide suggests using the [+] menu to add equipment to the scene, dragging and dropping things on the trashcan to delete them, and using cables to connect different equipment.
- The tool is limited to a maximum of 4 speakers.
- Users are encouraged to join the community's Discord, showcase their work, and check out cool stuff built by others.
- Donations and support on Patreon are appreciated by the creator, Johan Peitz.
- picoSYNTH is rated 4.8 out of 5 stars with 22 total ratings.
- It is made with PICO-8 and tagged as Audio, chiptune, DIY, Music, Music Production, PICO-8, Pixel Art, and Synthwave.
- The tool is available for purchase as part of a bundle deal on itch.io for $2.96 USD during the Halloween Sale.

      USB-C head-to-head teardown
     </h3>
     <p class="summary">
      - Apple's Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) Pro cable supports Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB 4 data transfer with speeds up to 40 Gb/s and can deliver up to 100 W of power.
- The Thunderbolt connector has a stainless steel enclosure and a strain relief crimped in from eight different directions.
- The Thunderbolt cable has 24 pins on a 10-layer PCB board with blind and buried vias.
- There is a wiggle detour on one of the traces to ensure the same length as its paired trace for high-speed data transmission.
- The Thunderbolt cable contains different types of wires for charging and data transfer, including coaxially shielded conductors for high-speed data and unshielded wires for power and legacy USB 2.0 functionality.
- Amazon Basics USB-C cable is much cheaper and offers charging up to 60 W and data transfer speeds up to 480 Mbps.
- The Amazon Basics connector has two-armed strain relief and shielding anchored on the cable, with only 12 pins, four pairs of which are jumped across the PCBA.
- The NiceTQ USB-C cable is a primitive cable with no metal shielding, a plastic enclosure strain relief, and eight pins, with only four connecting to the cable.
- The NiceTQ cable has straightforward stranded conductors embedded in two layers of insulation, but it only supports USB 2.0 speeds.
- The ATYFUER USB-C cable is a charging cable with a full set of 24 pins on a PCB, though only 12 are connected to traces and wires configured for U.
